I put all my time into a nice girl and all I got was this lousy feeling.
DETACH FULLY
I want to fly to you but I also want the plane to crash to make it seem like you were worth it.
Enjoy your day. It's always beautiful where you are.

I wanted to be something your mother would approve of.

I forget how many people I nurtured that I've lost to nature.
Sometimes I think about how worried I was. Other times I remember you took lifeguard classes. Most of the time I think about the drive back.
You didn't come up for air and I was certain the waves were trying to convince me to go back home, too.
Do you think your children will ever wonder what you were like when you were 21 but be afraid to ask?
I didn't get my jaw broken but I did get a good reminder.
It's weird loving something you've never seen move. It's when I see skyscrapers and their windows into your callousness, photos of you.
Hospital beds feel more comfortable than sleeping with you in October.
A quiet life for a loud thing.
All I wanted in life was a nice girl who didn't get mad too much and a cabin with enough land for my dog to be happy.

CAPRICORN: you work so hard for something that will never work out for you.

I can figure out how much you love me just by what time you get out of bed.
All I want is someone to love and not that like dumb "I wanna kiss and hold hands" no I want someone to love that just wants to sleep

Have you ever tried so hard for something because you knew if you didn't have it you didn't have anything else worth waking up for
You're not strong enough for this heavy heart, it doesn't matter how much you drink.
Do you wanna argue or do you wanna shut up and kiss?
I'm sorry I'm like this.
You fall asleep in the car. You wake up and don't know how long everyone's been dead for. You remove your seatbelt and get out to smoke.
Why do people enjoy laying in the sun? Just lay next to her.

Is it okay if I fall in love with you or should I just take the stairs?
I want my cake and I want to eat it off of you.
If I say I wanna fuck you, what I mean is I want to watch you bend over a lot and make me wish I never met you.
Hey girl are you in a relationship bc if you say yes I'll try twice as hard

You're wondering what the car ride would be like if you drove all the way home with her.
Intimacy is waking up before her alarm goes off. Getting her stuff ready and kissing her eyelids good morning.

Wanna kiss you in a cave so it lasts longer. Want whatever I can't hear you say to echo back to me later.
You can tell me you love me now.
There are other hours aside from 3am and I feel strongly about the ones that you are dressed for.
Sometimes I wonder what Atlantis must have been like, and then I look at you.

You get in your car. You turn it on. Instead of that dinging no seat belt sound, it's her voice saying your name, and laughing softly.
First base is texting. Second base is photos. Third base is phone calls. Home run is flying across the country to meet them.
I met God and she's in love with another woman.
I am not happy anywhere I go without you.
She uses distance to her advantage. She knows she can't just come here and kiss me anymore.

SAGITTARIUS: it's so hard to think when everything about you reminds me of my mother, before she shut down.
LIBRA: there is no sound coming from their chest but you'll keep kissing the air into them.
CANCER: I want to worship you between the sheets right before I nail your wrists to the headboard, my savior.
VIRGO: loving you in places I don't even remember but there's empty cigarette packs stamped from every state.
SCORPIO: this garden would work to keep you sane if our hands were touching in the dirt.
GEMINI: how could we not love something that changes so much?
TAURUS: you put everything into them and they will pull it out every single night if you let them get that close again.
AQUARIUS: let them in slowly, their hands will feel like you're being robbed. Let them in slowly, and do not let them amuse you.
PISCES: rest your legs, rest your body. The morning brings warmth, thick as honey.
ARIES: even the devil's lovers know your name.
CAPRICORN: here you are. The world is flat again and your heartbeat is just as dull.

Sometimes call you drunk just to upset you.
I'll find you in side effect labels and dark ales. I'll find you in every girl with clean feet and wanderlust.
You'll never hear songs that remind you of me unless you look for them. You'll remember what a snob I am. The skyline will spell my name.
I'll be somewhere new. Portland. You'll be figuring out the New York subway. We will never speak again, but everything will be a reminder.
You'll wake up one day. Everything will feel different. You'll question how this was possible, our conversations; what were we thinking?
I came to twitter for the sad girls with nice butts and the other girls that won't let me talk about their butts but have powerful opinions

The only thing you're good at is explaining why drowning is safer than falling in love.
